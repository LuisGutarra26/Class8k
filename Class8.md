Key facts that were read on the Week Notes 8 were learning about operating systems, instance types, and container types.

Here are my interest quotes. Quote 1: "Container in cloud computing is used to build blocks, which help in producing operational efficiency, version control, developer productivity and environmental consistency." It was interesting because the user gets assured of reliability, consistency, and acting quick. Quote 2: "To prepare your application to run on Amazon ECS, you create a task definition which is a text file that describes one or more containers, up to a maximum of ten, that form your application." It felt important to learn this as to be familiar on what application data volumes, ports, and which contsainers to use.

What I leatned new was learning about what a task is in AWS, EKS making easy for you to run Kubernetes without needing installtion, and how Lambda you can run code without administration.

No questions.
